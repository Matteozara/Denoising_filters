# Denoising Point Clouds with filters
Here there is the code to denoise pointcloud with filters (Bilateral and a custom implementation of the 3D Guided filter).
<br>
To run the code:

1. Download the images from [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ArX3986HKwGFKIurK-Ls3kkTTqVwAJpl?usp=sharing)
<br>
2. Place the images inside the "Dataset" folder
<br>
3. <i>run main.py</i> to use the selected NYU dataset environment to try the denoising algorithms or <i>run my_main.py</i> to use my acquisition to try the denoising algorithms
<br>
4. The results will be saved on the "Results" folder
